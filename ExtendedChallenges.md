# Challenge - Mini Calculator
Create a small calculator application that can add two numbers together.

## Requirements
- There must be two inputs on the page where a user can enter the numbers they wish to add
- There must be a button labeled "calcuate" on the page to execute the calculation
- There must be a div with the ID of "result" 
- When the button is clicked, calculate the sum of the two numbers
- Update the result div with the calcuated result

### Extra
If you finish the basic calculator, you can add more buttons for subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Extra Extra
If you are ambitious, you can replace your two inputs with one input, and replace your operation buttons with one button that will calculate whatever the user has specified in the input. For example, they could enter "1 + 2", "2*7", "10 /2", etc. You will have to _parse_ the text the enter to figure out what the numbers are and what calculation they want to perform.
