# Challenge - Fake Angular App
Try to copy a small Angular application using **only** HTML and CSS.

The example is here: https://angular-6-registration-login-example.stackblitz.io/login

## Requirements
- There should be two HTML files - one for Login and one for Register
    - The pages should link to each other via the "Register" and "Cancel" links
- The appropriate input fields should be added to the pages
- The styles should match the example as closely as possible
- When the fields are active, a blue highlight should appear around them
- You do **not** need to make the Login button work when clicked, but it should still appear
