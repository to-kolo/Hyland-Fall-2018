# Individual Exercise - JS Review
In this exercise, you will need to start from the file `IndividualStartingPoint.html`. Once you have your file, follow the instructions below. Feel free to use the internet or any other resources to help you complete the activity.

## Part 1 - Interactivity
1. When the "alert" button is clicked, display a message to the user. You will need to:
    - Define a function in JavaScript
    - Make the function display a message (use the `alert` function to accomplish this)
    - Hook the function up to the button
2. Add three more buttons to the page, labeled "prompt", "ask", and "checkbox"
3. When the "prompt" button is clicked, ask the user what message they want to see. Then, show them that message. Use the `prompt` function to accomplish this
4. When the "ask" button is clicked, ask the user if they want to see a message at all. If they say "yes", show them a message. Otherwise, do not show them anything. Use an `if` to accomplish this
5. When the "checkbox" button is clicked, use the value of the checkbox on your page to determine whether or not the user should see a message. If the checkbox is checked, show them a message. If the checkbox is NOT checked, do not show them a message. Use the `document.querySelector` function to accomplish this
