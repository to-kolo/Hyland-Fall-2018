# Individual Exercise - HTML/CSS/JS Review
In this exercise, you will need to create a new HTML page from scratch. Once you have your file, follow the instructions below. Feel free to use the internet or any other resources to help you complete the activity.

## Part 1 - HTML Elements
1. Add the basic tags necessary to begin your page - `html`, `body`, `head`, `style`, `script`
1. Add a header to your page
1. Add four paragraphs to your page
1. Add a link to your page
1. Add a checkbox input to your page
1. Add a button to your page
1. Make sure every element displays on its own line _(you will have to use some other tags (or styles) to accomplish this)_

## Part 2 - Styles
1. Make the link on your page appear bigger
1. Make the **first** paragraph on your page bold, but not any of the others
1. For **the other three** paragraphs on your page (but not the first one):
    - Make them blue
    - Make them italic
    - Make the cursor turn into a crosshair when you hover over them 
1. When the user's mouse hovers over the button, make its text green
1. Set the background of your page to be an image

## Part 3 - Interactivity
1. When the button is clicked, display a message to the user. You will need to:
    - Define a function in JavaScript
    - Make the function display a message
    - Hook the function up to the button
1. Instead of simply displaying a message, ask the user what message they want to see. Then, show them that message. Use the `prompt` function to accomplish this
1. Instead of asking which message they want to see, ask them if they want to see a message at all. If they say "yes", show them a message. Otherwise, do not show them anything. Use an `if` to accomplish this
1. Instead of asking the user anything, simply use the value of the checkbox on your page. If the checkbox is checked, show them a message. If the checkbox is NOT checked, do not show them a message. Use the `document.querySelector` function to accomplish this
